Installed KSP-CKAN mod manager after having read kindle book "The Kerbal Players Guide" during vacation

Using Mods:
    KSP Engineer Redux (didnt want mechjob, cause didnt want to automate.)
    RemoteTech (If i cant due RF, what can I do...)
    KRPC (Kerbal space program remote protocol client...)
    SCANSat (RADAR ALTIMETER)
    AGExt (action groups extended)
    remote tech missions
    scan sat missions
    other cruft (Kerbal Alarm Clock, Contract Configurator, Module Manager)

Looking to use sqrt range mode for remote tech, etc.

Did some digging, i think im crashing on startup due to using KSP 1.3 from steam (seems to be mostly a language pack - i dont care). Trying to move installed dir to 1.2.2 to get mods to run. THANKS OBAMA. Need to disable auto update.
